# Money

Later I might come up with a more creative name, until now it shall be Money.
I started with this project because other alternatices to GnuCash or HomeBank costs tons of money and I can't seem to work with the aforementioned software packages.

## Getting Started

Downloads are located in the tag section of this repository.
I strongly advice to use a stable release if you plan to use this as your primary means of managing your financials.

### Prerequisites

All required DLLs are in the release zip's
The only thing you need is .NET Framework 4.0+

### Installing

Unzip and run the exe.
