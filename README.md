# Money

Later I might come up with a more creative name, until now it shall be Money.
I started with this project because other alternatices to GnuCash or HomeBank costs tons of money and I can't seem to work with the aforementioned software packages.

## Getting Started

Downloads are located in the tag section of this repository.
I strongly advice to use a stable release if you plan to use this as your primary means of managing your financials.

### Prerequisites

Aside from all required DLLs which are packaged with every release, you'll need the following installed:
* .NET Core 2.0+
* Gtk#

### Running/Installing

There is currently no installer but you can compile it yourself ;)

```
wget archive.zip https://git.stardebris.net/stardebris/money/repository/v0.1.0/archive.zip
unzip archive.zip
cd MoneyMUI/
dotnet run
```
